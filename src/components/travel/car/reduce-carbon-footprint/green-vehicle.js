                Hybrid and electric cars use electricity as fuel, generating fewer emissions than their gas-guzzling counterparts. Plus, if charged with clean electricity from renewable sources, electric cars produce zero CO2. Using cleaner fuels and a fuel-efficient car helps too. Some fuels can reduce emissions by up to 80% compared to gasoline! Go ahead and check out the EPAâ€™s Green Vehicle Guide. Depending on where you live, after incentives and gas savings, it can cost next to nothing to swap your car for an electric one.
