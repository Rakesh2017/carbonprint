            <p>
                Nobody likes seeing a car puff black smoke from its tailpipe or leak an oil stain onto the asphalt at a red light. Itâ€™s gross! Keep your car tuned and running efficiently.

                Speeding, rapid acceleration, and unnecessary breaking can lower your gas mileage by 33% which means increase the carbon release by 33%, is like paying an extra $0.12-$0.79 per gallon. What a waste. So, accelerate smoothly, drive steadily at the speed limit (use Cruise Control), and anticipate your stops.
